Basically this site should behave like this one here: http://samedaysforever.com/
When the window is clicked and dragged: 
  1 ) videos should move along the mouse (left or right)
  2 ) at the same time videos should invert play 
                  > when mouse drag is left videos run naturally forward 
                  > when mouse drag goes right videos runs backwards
When a single video is clicked
  1) that video is enlarged and starts from the begining 
  2) next to the video there should be a side bar with some information and controls (minimise video, text and links)
  3) the site keeps on running in the back
  
 
I have mad it to the point of moving the videos around, detecting if there is a click or a drag.
This is how much i have done at the moment i am writing this: http://vitoria.internetbravo.net/
